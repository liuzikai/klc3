KLC3: KLEE on LC-3
==================

A symbolic execution engine to provide end-to-end feedback and specific test cases to students on their LC-3 programs.

Currently, KLC3 supports the LC-3 ISA introduced in _Introduction To Computing Systems (2nd Edition)_ by Patt And Patel.

=> KLC3 is a part of our end-to-end automatic feedback system for LC-3 programs, which was presented at ASE 2021. For the replication package, please refer to this repo: [liuzikai/lc3-feedback-system-artifact](https://github.com/liuzikai/lc3-feedback-system-artifact)


## Install
### Docker Image

Using KLC3 with Docker is similar to that of KLEE: [KLEE's guide](https://klee.github.io/releases/docs/v2.2/docker/).

To pull the Docker image from DockerHub:
```
docker pull liuzikai/klc3:latest
```

Alternatively, to build the Docker image locally:

```
docker build -t liuzikai/klc3 .
```

To create a temporary container:
```
docker run --rm -ti --ulimit='stack=-1:-1' liuzikai/klc3
```

Alternatively, to create a persistent container:
```
docker run -ti --name=my_first_klc3_container --ulimit='stack=-1:-1' liuzikai/klc3
```

### Build from Source
KLC3 makes use of KLEE's build system with a few modifications. KLC3 is configured as a CMake target built along with
the original targets.

Please follow the KLEE build guide: [Building KLEE with LLVM 9](https://klee.github.io/releases/docs/v2.2/build-llvm9/), with the following modifications:
* Only **STP solver** is currently supported! KLC3 uses symbolic arrays with domain and range of `Int16`. We have done some modifications into KLEE's infrastructure but only for the STP solver currently.
* Graphviz and Flex are required to generate control flow graphs: `sudo apt install libgraphviz-dev flex libfl-dev` (Ubuntu) or `brew install graphviz flex` (macOS).

## Examples in KLC3 User Manual

KLC3 user manual contains a few examples, including LC-3 programs and wrappers.

[`get_sign`](klc3-manual/examples/get_sign) is a simple example that illustrates the issue detection capability of KLC3.
[`get_sign.asm`](klc3-manual/examples/get_sign/get_sign.asm) is an LC-3 program that contains two trivial bugs, which
are triggered depending on the sign of an input integer.

The KLC3 output is in [`klc3-out-0`](klc3-manual/examples/get_sign/klc3-out-0). To run KLC3 yourself
(using the Docker image as example):

```
cd ~/klee_src/klc3-manual/examples/get_sign
./run_klc3.sh
```

We also provide a few real LC-3 programming assignments. We include test programs and gold programs (correct versions
of the code) written by us (we cannot provide student code).

If no gold program is supplied, KLC3 only detects problems during the execution of the test program
(execution issues in the [KLC3 manual](klc3-manual)).

To enable the equivalence checking on output, memory, registers, and/or the last executed instruction
(behavioral issues in the [KLC3 manual](klc3-manual)),
KLC3 needs a gold program to run along with a test program.

[MP1 from ECE220 FA20 ZJUI section](klc3-manual/examples/zjui_ece220_fa20/mp1) requires students to write two
subroutines `PRINT_CENTERED` and `PRINT_SLOT`.
[klc3-out-buggy_print_centered](klc3-manual/examples/zjui_ece220_fa20/mp1/print_centered/examples/klc3-out-buggy_print_centered)
shows the output of a make-up buggy example.

To run KLC3:

```
cd ~/klee_src/klc3-manual/examples/zjui_ece220_fa20/mp1/print_centered
./run_klc3.sh examples/mp1_buggy_print_centered.asm
```

The default output directory is `klc3-out-*` under the same directory as the last loaded test asm file. In this example,
the output directory is in `examples` subdirectory.

[MP2](klc3-manual/examples/zjui_ece220_fa20/mp2) is a more complicated assignment.
[Output of a buggy program](klc3-manual/examples/zjui_ece220_fa20/mp2/examples/klc3-out-buggy).

[MP3](klc3-manual/examples/zjui_ece220_fa20/mp3) is an even more complicated assignment. Executing KLC3 with the given
input space typically takes 2 to 5 minutes.

We also include [MPs from ECE220 FA18 ZJUI section](klc3-manual/examples/zjui_ece220_fa18), which are slightly
different from those of FA20.

## Source Overview
KLC3 mostly follows the source code structure of KLEE (v2.2, described in [Developer's Guide · KLEE](https://klee.github.io/releases/docs/v2.2/docs/developers-guide/).
* `include/klc3` contains headers.
* `lib/klc3` contains most of the code.
* `tools` contains a few executable tools.
* `tests-klc3` contains small LC-3 programs that serve as automatic system tests for KLC3.
* `klc3-manual` contains the user manual and examples for instructors.
